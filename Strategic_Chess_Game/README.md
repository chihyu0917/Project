### Description
Created a chess-playing game that could predict optimal moves for both human players and computer opponents, 
ensuring the first player had a high chance of winning.
Implemented a node-based system for recording information about each game board, including parents, children, 
and paths; optimized efficiency and reduced processing time by 30% through Alpha-beta pruning.
Developed a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for the chess game that provides optimal moves for the 
first player, enabling enhanced strategic depth in human-computer chess matches.
