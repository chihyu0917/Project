### Strategic Chess Game
Created a chess-playing game that could predict optimal moves for both human players and computer opponents, ensuring the first player had a high chance of winning. Implemented a node-based system for recording information about each game board, including parents, children, and paths; optimized efficiency and reduced processing time by 30% through Alpha-beta pruning
### Star Maze Game
Using JavaScript WebGL/OpenGL to draw all objects in 3D space. Using HTML/CSS to present the interface. In addition, each planet can reflect the environment. The viewpoint of players and background can be moved and rotated, the music starts as the game starts, and players have to reach the end of the maze without touching obstacles to pass the level. The game has two levels.
### Face Recognition in KPOP
To solve the problem of recognizing many members of Korean groups, it uses face recognition technology to help the director recognize people in a short time. Using OpenCV to train the face model and inferred face model in Python. It uses lots of photos to train first, and then play the video to identify the person.
